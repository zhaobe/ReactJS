# ReactJSRepository for exploring ReactJS and getting familiar with it's features.notes:- ```npm run dev``` is set to run the webpack with the watch option.- ```npm run build``` is set to run the webpack in production mode.- ```npm run start``` exports the configuration object.- ReactDOM.render only updates DOM elements that have changed.- This is done by what is called virtual DOM.## JSX- You can't use the attribute `class`, instead you will use `className`, which is rendered into class attributes.- For self-closing tags, such as `<br>, <img>, etc`, you will need to include the slash, e.g. `<br />, <img />`.- Adding a pair of curly braces to the JSX element will yield Javascript evaluation.- Always use curly braces for JS injection. [This link](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) has more information for JSX compilation.- Wrapping a JSX element with curly braces and the `&&` operator will only render that element if it evaluates to true. Refer to link with JS injection above.- List tags need keys if there are items that retain memory from a render to another or when the list order gets shuffled by render.## React Components- `React.createClass` takes in one argument, it has to be a Javascript Object.
